    <p> Muhammad Ali Jinnah[a] (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai[b];
         25 December 1876 â€“ 11 September 1948) was a barrister,
        
         politician, and the founder 
        of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the
        
        leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913
        until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, 
        
        
        and then as the Republic of Pakistan's first governor-general
        until his death. </p>
    </pre>
    <p> The Fourteen Points of Jinnah were proposed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in response to the Nehru report. It consisted
        of four Delhi proposals, the three Calcutta amendments, demands for the continuation of separate electorates and
        reservation of seats for Muslims in government services and self-governing bodies. In 1928, an All Parties
        Conference was convened in reaction to the Simon Commission appointed to discuss parliamentary reform in British
        India. A committee was set up under Motilal Nehru which prepared the "Nehru Report". This report demanded
        "Dominion Status" for India. Separate electorates were refused and the reservation of seats for the Muslims of
        Bengal and Punjab was rejected. The Nehru Report did not uphold a single demand of the Muslim League. In
        reaction to the Nehru Report, the League authorised Jinnah to draft in concise terms the basis of any future
        constitution for India. Jinnah aimed to safeguard the interests of Muslims. He gave his 14 points which covered
        the interests of Muslims and in these 14 points Jinnah stated it was the "parting of ways" and that he did not
        want anything to do with the Indian National Congress in the future. The League leaders motivated Jinnah to
        revive the Muslim League and give it direction. As a result, these points became the demands of the League and
        greatly influenced the Muslims' thinking for the next two decades until the establishment of Pakistan in 1947
